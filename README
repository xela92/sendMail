This program aims to help having an easy-to-use tool to send mails with a simple
syntax, and very little configuration to do.

The only requirement is Java (I'm using version 8).

To start with sendMail, just create a file in your home directory called

".mail.conf"

you can also use /etc/mail.conf on a Linux system.

The file should be like this:


smtp=smtp.myserver.com
port=25
sender_mail=mail@myserver.com
sender_name=MyName
needs_auth=true
user=mail@myserver.com
password=mypassword
needs_SSL=false


I think it's easy enough to understand. ;-)

You can directly use the JAR binary file in exe folder of this project, 
it includes the lib folder.

I suggest you to move the jar in a folder you want (I made a jbin folder
in /usr/local) and create a script like this in $PATH

#!/bin/bash
java -jar /usr/local/jbin/sendMail.jar "$@"

[CHANGELOG]

if you want, from the latest version it's possible to specify logs directory in configuration file.

logs_directory=/path/to/logs

On Windows, you need to specify it doubling all the backslashes, like this:

logs_directory=C:\\logs\\directory

I've also added version information, you can find it out using 

java -jar sendMail.jar version
