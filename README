This program aims to help having an easy-to-use tool to send mails with a simple
syntax, and very little configuration to do.

The only requirement is Java (I'm using version 8).

To start with sendMail, just create a file in your home directory called

".mail.conf"

you can also use /etc/mail.conf on a Linux system.

The file should be like this:


smtp=smtp.myserver.com
port=25
sender_mail=mail@myserver.com
sender_name=MyName
needs_auth=true
user=mail@myserver.com
password=mypassword
needs_SSL=false


I think it's easy enough to understand. ;-)
